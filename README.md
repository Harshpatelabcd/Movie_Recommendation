Concept Used
1. Cosine Similarity: Cosine similarity is one of the most popular and common ways to determine similarity among users or items. Ranging from 0 to 1, cosine similarity tells us about the angle that forms between two vectors in n-dimensional space. The closer the cosine value to 1, the more similar the two vectors are.
